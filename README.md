# OpenWork

OpenWork is a free, open-source desktop app made for sharing AI workflows. It is an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork and Codex for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Add one OpenWork MCP to Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another compatible agent and reuse the same skills, MCPs, and connected services across your tools, teammates, and machines. Create something once, share it with coworkers or friends, or keep it for yourself.

The desktop app is there when you want a dedicated workspace, but it is not required. You can use OpenWork from the agent you already have. For larger organizations, the admin interface lets you publish capabilities, manage access, and configure shared or per-user connections.

## Install with your AI agent

```text

## Use OpenWork from any agent

The OpenWork MCP brings your assigned skills, plugins, MCP connections, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365 capabilities into any compatible agent.

It exposes two tools: `search_capabilities` finds what you can use, and `execute_capability` runs it. After adding the MCP, your client opens a browser so you can sign in and choose your OpenWork organization.

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add openwork --url https://api.openworklabs.com/mcp/agent
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http openwork https://api.openworklabs.com/mcp/agent
```

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "openwork": {
      "type": "remote",
      "enabled": true,
      "url": "https://api.openworklabs.com/mcp/agent",
      "oauth": {}
    }
  }
}
```
